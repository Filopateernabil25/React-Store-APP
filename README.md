# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🛒 React-Store-APP

> **Description:**  
This is a hands-on project: a **React Product App** that fetches data from an external API and displays it beautifully using **Bootstrap**.  

In this project, I did the following:  
- Used **React Context API** for global state management.  
- Fetched product data from an API using **Axios**.  
- Implemented **Routing** between pages with **React Router**.  
- Added **SweetAlert2 alerts** for user actions.  
- Improved **SEO** for each page using **React Helmet**.  
- Added **offline detection** to notify users when they lose internet connection.  
- Added **loading spinners** while data is being fetched.  

> Check the screenshots below to see how the app looks in action.
